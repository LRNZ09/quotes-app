### Folder Structure

Here is the core folder structure:

```
quotes-app/

|- build
|- ios

|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project:

```
lib/

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

2- screens - Contains the screens used within the app for navigation.
5- utilsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains the utilities/common functions of your application.

8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application, where we also initialize Firebase.
